# Llama 4  Maverick
Big news in the AI world! Meta has officially released LLaMA-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8, a powerful new language model that’s already making waves across the developer community. 🌍

🧩 What’s New?

17B active parameters, powered by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
128 Experts — with only a subset active per forward pass for better efficiency
Multilingual capabilities and strong reasoning across text + vision
Optimized for instruction-following, making it ideal for chatbots, copilots, and educational tools
Released in FP8 format for faster inference and deployment
🎯 Whether you're building apps, chat interfaces, or LLM-powered tools, this model brings serious horsepower and flexibility — and it's available right now via Together AI and other providers.

👨‍💻 I just integrated it into an ASP.NET Razor Pages app (yes — .NET + AI!), and the results are 🔥. This is a model to watch if you're working with:

LLM APIs
Multi-turn dialogue systems
Open-source AI deployments

📅 Released: April 5, 2025
